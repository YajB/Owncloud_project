# ownCloud_project - notes
Bogging down in details and markdown issues. 
In Kramdown, I know how to format branching tabs, which would have been useful for this doc: I'd have separated the Admin  Installation/Configuration and User Connect to server flows into tabs

The existing documentation is a hellish rabbit hole. The doc structure is all over the place. 
Users need a clear path to the best options. 
Consider limiting the scope of the installation to the recommended requirements.


Quick start should include minimum requirements, MVP/happy flows ("Just the facts, Jack"), and direct users who need more complicated installations to the relevant sections of the ownCloud dox.
